Welcome to the WebPage Load Time Calculator, a powerful Python tool designed to measure the loading times of web pages using Selenium. This tool is particularly useful for web developers, SEO specialists, and performance analysts who are keen on optimizing website performance.

## Key Features:
- **Automated Load Time Measurement**: Utilizes Selenium WebDriver to automatically navigate through a given list of URLs and measure their load times.
